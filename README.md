# Personal Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for various tools and applications I use in my development environment.
These configurations are tailored to my workflow and preferences, primarily focusing on tmux, Neovim, and the fish shell.

## Overview

- **Neovim**: Configured with Lazy.nvim as the package manager and Catppuccin as the color scheme.
- **tmux**: Using TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager) for plugin management and Catppuccin for theming.
